# Sample access control policy:
#	Root DSE: allow anyone to read it
#	Subschema (sub)entry DSE: allow anyone to read it
#	Other DSEs:
#		Allow self write access
#		Allow authenticated users read access
#		Allow anonymous users to authenticate
#	Directives needed to implement policy:
access to * by * manage
#	by dn.one="uid=bind,dc=my-domain,dc=com" manage
#	by self write
#	by * read
#	by * search
#	by * auth
#access to dn.base="" by * read
#access to dn.base="cn=Subschema" by * read
# if no access controls are present, the default policy
# allows anyone and everyone to read anything but restricts
# updates to rootdn.  (e.g., "access to * by * read")
#
# rootdn can always read and write EVERYTHING!
